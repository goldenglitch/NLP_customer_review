    "Sentiment analysis is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that consists in extracting emotions related to some raw texts. This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users are positive or negative and why.

The higher the curve is above the diagonal baseline, the better the predictions. Although the AUC ROC (Area Under the Curve ROC) is very good, we should not use here the ROC curve to assess the quality of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? First let us remind the False Positive Rate formula, which corresponds to the x axis of the ROC curve: FPR (False Positive Rate) = # False Positives / # Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the # Negatives corresponds to our number of good reviews which is very high because our dataset is imbalanced. This means that even with some False Positives, our FPR will tend to stay very low. Our model will be able to make a lot of false positives predictions and still have a low false positive rate, while increasing the true positive rate and therefore artificially increasing the AUC ROC metric."

    "A better metric in this imbalanced situation is the AUC PR (Area Under the Curve Precision Recall), or also called AP (Average Precision). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the precision decreases when we increase the recall. This shows us that we have to choose a prediction thresold adapted to our needs. If our goal is to have a high recall, we should set a low prediction thresold that will allow us to detect most of the observations of the positive class, but with a low precision. On the contrary, if we want to be really confident about our predictions but don't mind about not finding all the positive observations, we should set a high thresold that will get us a high precision and a low recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know if our model performs better than another classifier, we can simply use the AP metric. To assess the quality of our model, we can compare it to a simple decision baseline. Let's take a random classifier as a baseline here that would predict half of the time 1 and half of the time 0 for the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a classifier would have a precision of 4.3%, which corresponds to the proportion of positive observations. For every recall value the precision would stay the same, and this would lead us to an AP of 0.043. The AP of our model is approximately 0.35, which is more than 8 times higher than the AP of the random method. This means that our model has a good predictive power."
